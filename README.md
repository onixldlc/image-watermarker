# image-watermarker
this is a single html page, used for generating image with watermark, (it is so that you wont need to send what ever your image is to a backend server to be "processed")

and added support for custom svg watermark, just incase you have a custom watermark you want to apply to the original image 

> [!NOTE]
> you don't trust the site ? i.e. you want to watermark a private picture ? or an id thats needed to be sent to your hr ? well not to worry as i wont take your data... and if you still don't trust my word... just download the html to an isolated vm. since this watermarker is only a bundle of html css and js, aslong IT has a browser, IT can watermark things...
